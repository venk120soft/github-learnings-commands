First we have to make the path or folder should be git enabled for that we need to initialize first

cd c:\gitHubProjectPath 
git init

then to Config our Email and  password Globally
1) git config --global user.name "John Doe"
2) git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

then if you want to change the user name and email then you can change the user name and email

1) git config user.name "John Doe"
2) git config user.email johndoe@example.com

Now we  can create the project and push to git (or)
Clone the repository 

git clone gitUrltobecloned
ex: git clone https://github.com/venk120soft/github-learnings-commands.git
That means we are taking the whole project into our local Computer. Once the clone is done we can able to see all the files in our local system.
