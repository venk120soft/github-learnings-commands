------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First we have to make the path or folder should be git enabled for that we need to initialize first

cd c:\gitHubProjectPath 
git init

then to Config our Email and  password Globally
1) git config --global user.name "John Doe"
2) git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

then if you want to change the user name and email then you can change the user name and email

1) git config user.name "John Doe"
2) git config user.email johndoe@example.com

Now we  can create the project and push to git (or)
Clone the repository 

git clone gitUrltobecloned
ex: git clone https://github.com/venk120soft/github-learnings-commands.git
That means we are taking the whole project into our local Computer. Once the clone is done we can able to see all the files in our local system 

Now do the changes, add the files modified the files delete the files what ever you do 
git add fileName (or)
To add all files at a time
git add -a 

what ever we do the changes to files we are indexing them then once we indexed everything we are making the commit

git commit -m "Describe what you did in this commit" 

then push to the repository by using below command

git push

if it ask for credentials we have to mention then it will be pushed into 

Working with branches

Creating branch

git branch sampleBranchName

Now the branch is created, then now all the master code is available in sampleBranchName branch
we can check all the branches for the repository by using below command
git branch 
this will list out all the branches for that repository

How to check the current working branch name ?
Git branch
will list out all the branches, in this the current working branch name will be heighlated in grean color

How do you switch to the branches??
Once the branch is created then want to work on that branch we have to switch to that branch. for that 

git checkout branchWeWantToWork

ex: git checkout sampleBranchName

This will switch the branch to sampleBranchName branch  do the changes you need .
Then push the newly created branch to the upstream by using below command

 git push --set-upstream origin testBranch

Every newly created needs to pushed to the Origin

this may ask for the credentials we have to keyin the credentials, 
Then We can commit and push our changes to the newly created branch.
git branch newBranch2

Fork Means Having full copy of source code into our own account, So that even though the original code is deleted, we will have a copy of it in our code.
